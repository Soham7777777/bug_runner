# My Experience
---
- It was really fun while making this game. The main takeaway was OOP in this game, before this game I had no idea about the purpose of OOP. And one more thing is that `actual physics < fun and ease of programming`, the gravity for the player is not real "Newton's Gravity Law", I've made it so it feels real.
- What makes a good game really good? Before I made this game my answer was `code` but after making this game my answer changed: `their assets like sound, music, graphics etc... `
- If you find any bugs please let me know, if you are adding new features to this game then I would really enjoy them !!

### Enjoy the game!
